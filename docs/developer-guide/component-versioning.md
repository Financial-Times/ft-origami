This page should:

1. explain semver
1. explain bundle conflicts
1. explain shrinkwrapping

/// dumped out from the modules tutorial, don't forget to talk about this:
<aside>
	<h4>v0.x.x: Beware!</h4>
	<p>Versions lower than 1 (eg. <code>v0.3.2</code>) are considered experimental builds, and are treated differently by Bower.  Origami forbids the creation of components with a version lower than 1, so if you see one, it is probably not ready for use.</p>

<aside>
	<h4>Semver calculator</h4>
	<p>If you want to understand more about how a <em>semver expression</em> matches specific versions, try npm's <a href='http://semver.npmjs.com'>semver calculator tool</a>.</p>
