# Roadmap

A list of Origami components and the current development activity around each one is currently [in a Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/ft.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao8hBnxkLX64dE5MS2VsdTdqNWVydkNXYjdOTVhCdWc&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

## Current activity

* Building modules and services
* Planning and setting up production environments for Origami registry, build service and component services
* Create a mechanism for prioritising component development
* Redefine Velcro as a living style guide site that brings together all Velcro modules, and build it

## Planned work

* Split the navigation app into a navigation web service and a navigation module.
* Build out further components to conformance with component standards, in order of decreasing value to the business.
* Validate component architecture with the proposed technology stack for Responsive ft.com
