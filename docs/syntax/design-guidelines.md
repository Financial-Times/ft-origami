# Design guidelines workflow

Design guidelines can be added to any component in the registry and can be written in Markdown format. Guidelines will appear below the component title and above the component demos.
This guide will take you through how to add design guidelines to a component using GitHub, by the end of the tutorial, you should be able to create, write, and submit a pull request to add the guidelines to the component.

## 1. Find the component on GitHub
To start adding or editing guidelines you will need to edit the component on GitHub. An easy way to find the component on GitHub, is to navigate to the component in the Registry and click the “View on GitHub” button in the top-right of the screen. Alternatively, you can search for the component on GitHub.

NB: At this point you will need to have a GitHub account, if you don’t have one, set one up now and speak to the Origami team to get the correct access to the FT repositories.

## 2. Add or select the `designguidelines.md` file
The next step is to add or update the design guidelines file.
In the main view of the component, you will see a list of files, if the file does not already exist, select the “Create new file” option at the top-right of the file list and name the file `designguidelines.md`.

This will take you into an edit mode for the file, where you can start writing the guidelines using Markdown.

Alternatively, if the `designguidelines.md` file is already in the list of files, you can select the file to view the guidelines that have already been added.
To edit the guidelines, select the “edit” option from the line above the file:

Once you have the file open or in edit mode, you’re ready to add the new guidelines. To format the guidelines, you’ll be using Markdown. A good guide to the Markdown syntax is found here: [Mastering Markdown · GitHub Guides](https://guides.GitHub.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
You can also preview the text you’re adding at any time using the preview tab in the top-left of the editor window.

## 3. Save the updated guidelines
Once you’ve finished editing the guidelines, you need to save or “commit” your changes. To do so, scroll to the bottom of the page where you will find the commit changes form.

In this section, you need to fill in at least the first field (description of the commit). Use either “Add design guidelines” or “Update design guidelines” depending on the work you’ve done. Leave the remainder of the form as above, and hit the “Commit new file” button. This will take you to the Pull Request screen.

## 4. Submit the changes as a pull request
The final step is to open a Pull Request to submit the new file or changes for approval and to get them merged into the active version of the component. When you committed your work in the previous step, it should have taken you to the pull request screen:

As the pull request only takes the single commit you’re adding, the PR fields should be auto-populated with all that is needed. Double check the descriptions are correct and then click the “Create pull request” button.

## 5. You’re done!
Now you’re all done. The Origami team will check the PR and merge it into the active version of the component and it should appear in the registry shortly after. Keep an eye on the [#ft-origami](https://financialtimes.slack.com/archives/ft-origami) Slack channel for the new release to be announced.
