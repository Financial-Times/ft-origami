# HTML Standards

Where Origami components include or output HTML, it should meet the following requirements:

* The markup *must* be [valid HTML5](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#syntax), except that a DOCTYPE, and opening `<html>` and `<body>` tags should be assumed (ie the markup should be a document body fragment which becomes a valid HTML5 document when enclosed in `<html>` and `<body>` tags).
* It must be well formed XML (ie. it must have a single root element, all elements that are opened must be closed, closing tags must be in order)
* Use semantic markup where native elements exist to describe the content (so use `<address>` not `<div class='address'>`)
* The root element of a fragment of markup that represents a module, must
	* have a class name of `ft-{modulename}-module` (see [SCSS standards]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/syntax/scss) for further details of class naming)
	* have a `data-version` attribute with the version number of the component from which the markup is sourced (which *should* be the module version, not the service version if the markup is generated by a service but sourced from a template in a module)
	* have a `data-component` attribute with the name of the component from which the markup is sourced
* The following **attributes** must not be present on any element:
	* ID
	* Event handler attributes, eg `onclick`, `onchange`
* The following **elements** must not be present:
	* SCRIPT
	* STYLE
	* BASE
	* LINK

## Tracking

In accordance with the [JavaScript standards]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/syntax/js), it's OK for a module to act on elements outside its owned portion of the DOM if those elements are tagged with data attributes within the module's namespace.  This principle is used to enable tracking of other modules by the track module.  Since the need for tracking is extremely common, these are defined as part of Origami itself:

* Where a portion of DOM comprises a list of links, the attribute `data-track-pos` should be added to the parent of each link.  The value of the attribute should be an integer reflecting the link's zero-based index in the list.
* Where a portion of DOM has distinct sub-regions that is worth tracking separately, such as a sub-list of links inside a list of links, the data attribute `data-track-region` should be added to the element enclosing the region.  The value may be any string describing the enclosed content.

## Examples

Headlines fragment:

	<nav class="ft-headlines-module" data-component="headlines" data-version="0.0.1">
	  <ul>
	    <li data-track-pos="0"><a href="http://www.ft.com">Home</a></li>
	    <li data-track-pos="1"><a href="http://www.ft.com/uk">UK</a></li>
	    <li data-track-pos="2"><a href="http://www.ft.com/world">World</a>
	      <ul data-track-region="storyPackage">
	      	<li><a href="http://www.ft.com/world/us">US</a></li>
	      	<li><a href="http://www.ft.com/world/china">China</a></li>
	      	<li><a href="http://www.ft.com/world/kazakstan">Kazakstan</a></li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</nav>
