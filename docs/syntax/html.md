# HTML Standards

Where Origami components include or output HTML, it should meet the following requirements:

* The markup *must* be [valid HTML5](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#syntax), except that a DOCTYPE, and opening `<html>` and `<body>` tags should be assumed (ie the markup should be a document body fragment which becomes a valid HTML5 document when enclosed in `<html>` and `<body>` tags).
* It *must* be well formed XML (ie. it must have a single root element, all elements that are opened must be closed, closing tags must be in order)
* Valueless attributes *must not* be used, because they are not valid XML:
	- GOOD: `<button disabled="disabled">Click me</button>`
	- BAD: `<button disabled>Click me</button>`
* Semantic markup *must* be used where native elements exist to describe the content:
	- GOOD: `<address>`
	- BAD: `<div class="address">`
* Elements or attributes that are normally singletons on a page *must not* be used in components. This includes attributes defined by specs external to the main HTML5 spec such as Microdata and WAI-ARIA. Examples:
	- BAD: `<meta name="viewport" content="..." />`
	- BAD: `<meta charset="utf-8">`
	- BAD: `<title>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
	- BAD: the `id` attribute (except as below)
	- BAD: the ARIA `role="main"` attribute
* The ID attribute *must not* be used, except where:
	* it identifies a form element that needs to be targeted by a `for` attribute; **and**
	* the value is namespaced with the name of the module, eg `o-signin-username`; **and**
	* the module only has singleton use cases (ie, it is pointless to include it in a product page more than once).  Any instances of forms within modules that may be used more than once on the same page may not have hard-coded IDs, but *may* use Mustache placeholders instead.
* HTML5 elements are allowed as long they can be polyfilled with JavaScript back to IE7, but markup *must not* contain custom elements.
* The following **elements** must not be used:
	* `<script>`
	* `<style>`
	* `<base>`
	* `<link>`
* Those elements and attributes which are deprecated in the HTML5 spec *should* not be used:
	- BAD: `<applet>`, `<frameset>`, `<font>`, `<link rev="">`, `<td align="right">`
* `<iframe>` *must* not be used in markup. Iframes may be created by JavaScript.
* Conditional comments *must not* be used in components or recommended to product developers. Components should instead rely on classes on the `body` or `html` element that indicate feature support. Component authors may require the product application to set any feature support classes supported by [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/docs/).  Product developers may of course choose to apply those classes using conditional comments rather than using Modernizr.
* HREFs in markup *must not* use the `javascript:` protocol.
* The following **attributes** must not be present on any element:
	* target
	* Event handler attributes, eg `onclick`, `onchange`
* The root element of a fragment of markup that represents a module, *must*
	* have a class name equal to its module name (which will start `o-`, see also [SCSS standards]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/syntax/scss) for further details of class naming)
	* have a `data-o-version` attribute with the version number of the component from which the markup is sourced (which *should* be the module version, not the service version if the markup is generated by a service but sourced from a template in a module).  Where markup is served by a web service component, the version *must* be populated with the correct value.  Where markup is stored in a module component's mustache template, it *must* be a variable rather than a value.
	* have a `data-o-component` attribute with the name of the component from which the markup is sourced

## Anticipating lack of script

Markup may contain elements that do not work without accompanying JavaScript.  Where those elements are progressive enhancements, they *must* be marked with a `modulename--js` class so that they can be made visible by the JavaScript:

	<li>Share on Facebook<span class='o-share__count o-share--js'></span></li>

If the elements are core to the functionality of the module, the module *should* advise the use of a `<noscript>` tag to offer feature fallback to users where the product developer opts not to run the JavaScript, or the user agent does not support it.

When providing `<noscript>` tag examples, module developers *must* include the module name and the string 'origami-noscript' as classes on the tag, and wrap the tag in conditonal comments like this:

	<![if gt IE 8]> <noscript class="o--noscript o-comments--noscript"> <![endif]>
	    <div class="o--noscript o-comments--noscript">To comment on this article, you need to upgrade your web browser.  <a href='...'>Learn how to upgrade</a>.</div>
	<![if gt IE 8]> </noscript> <![endif]>

This is because in Internet Explorer 8 and below, it's not possible to programmatically access the content of a NOSCRIPT tag, so those browsers will obey the conditional comments and will not wrap the message in a NOSCRIPT tag.

## WAI-ARIA

Component authors are encouraged to provide assistive accessibility information in their component's markup.

* use of the [widget](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#widget_roles) and [document structure](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#document_structure_roles) roles are encouraged but not required.
* use the [landmark roles](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#landmark_roles) with caution. These are probably the concern of the product application.
* do not use [abstract roles](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#abstract_roles).
* if using ARIA, for example a specific role and its associated attribute, follow the spec accurately across the entire component's code base. Half an implementation is worse than none at all.

## Tracking

In accordance with the [JavaScript standards]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/syntax/js), it's OK for a module to act on elements outside its owned portion of the DOM if those elements are tagged with data attributes within the module's namespace.  This principle is used to enable tracking of other modules by the track module.  Since the need for tracking is extremely common, these are defined as part of Origami itself:

* Where a portion of DOM comprises a list of links, the attribute `data-track-pos` should be added to the parent of each link.  The value of the attribute should be an integer reflecting the link's zero-based index in the list.
* Where a portion of DOM has distinct sub-regions that is worth tracking separately, such as a sub-list of links inside a list of links, the data attribute `data-track-region` should be added to the element enclosing the region.  The value may be any string describing the enclosed content.

## Examples

Headlines fragment:

	<nav class="o-headlines" data-o-component="o-headlines" data-o-version="0.0.1">
	  <ul>
	    <li data-track-pos="0"><a href="http://www.ft.com">Home</a></li>
	    <li data-track-pos="1"><a href="http://www.ft.com/uk">UK</a></li>
	    <li data-track-pos="2"><a href="http://www.ft.com/world">World</a>
	      <ul data-track-region="storyPackage">
	      	<li><a href="http://www.ft.com/world/us">US</a></li>
	      	<li><a href="http://www.ft.com/world/china">China</a></li>
	      	<li><a href="http://www.ft.com/world/kazakstan">Kazakstan</a></li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</nav>
