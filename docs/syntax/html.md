## HTML Standards

Where Origami components include or output HTML, it should meet the following requirements:

* The markup *must* be [valid HTML5](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#syntax), except that a DOCTYPE, and opening `<html>` and `<body>` tags should be assumed (ie the markup should be a document body fragment which becomes a valid HTML5 document when enclosed in `<html>` and `<body>` tags).
* It must be well formed XML (ie. it must have a single root element, all elements that are opened must be closed, closing tags must be in order)
* Use semantic markup where native elements exist to describe the content (so use `<address>` not `<div class='address'>`)
* The root element of a fragment of markup that represents a module, must
	* have a class name of `ft-{modulename}-module` (see [SCSS standards]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/syntax/scss) for further details of class naming)
	* have a `data-version` attribute with the version number of the module from which the markup is sourced (which *should* be the module version, not the service version if the markup is generated by a service)
* The following **attributes** must not be present on any element:
	* ID
	* Event handler attributes, eg `onclick`, `onchange`
* The following **elements** must not be present:
	* SCRIPT
	* STYLE
	* BASE
	* LINK
