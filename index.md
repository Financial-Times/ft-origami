<h2> <i class="fa fa-cubes"></i> Origami modules and services</h2>

At the heart of Origami are its services and modules.

Origami's modules are bits of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to include in your page. Some of them, like [gallery](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-gallery), come with a fully formed look and feel. Some of them, like [colors](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-colors) or [tracking](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-tracking) provide a foundation for building your own interfaces, or provide useful services without any interface at all.

Regardless of what they're made of, these modules have been comprehensively tested, comply with web accessibility standards, work or degrade gracefully in all of the browsers we support, and and provide a consistent experience of the FT brand. To see a complete list of the modules visit [registry.origami.ft.com/components](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components).

As well as modules, Origami provides the following services:

- [Polyfill.io](http://polyfill.io) - Upgrade the web automatically, code using the latest standards when writing JavaScript applications
- [The Image Service](http://image.webservices.ft.com/) - Deliver pictures in many formats and sizes; optimised and delivered over a a CDN.

Origami services and modules all comply with the [Origami Spec](/docs/component-spec/) and [Coding Standards](/docs/syntax/) to ensure they are high quality and interoperable. All modules are developed in the open on [GitHub](http://github.com/Financial-Times).
