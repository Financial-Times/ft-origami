<p class="alert-big">Origami is a set of standards, conventions and tools for building websites at the FT.</p>

<p class="alert-big">Origami aspires to create a <strong>unified style and experience for FT websites</strong>, and <strong>make web development at the FT faster</strong>.</p>

This standard is equally for component developers and those who want to build websites using existing components.  These two roles will be distinguished in this standard as **component developer** and **product developer**.

The things being built by component developers are **components**, while the sites, products, tools or services being build by the product developers as new services to FT readers are **product applications**.

## Where to start

* If you're a non-technical stakeholder wondering what all the fuss is about and how Origami will affect you, read the [overview]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/overview/non-technical), which explains what problems we are solving and how Origami will help
* If you're a product developer, read the [developer guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/developer-guide) to understand how to use Origami components in your product.
* If you're a component developer, read the [component spec]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/component-spec) which sets out the rules that your components must conform to in order to be Origami components.

## Who is using Origami?

Origami usage is widely spread across the business, as most of the teams at the FT are reporting to be using at least part of it:
