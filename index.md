<p class="alert-big">Origami is about empowering developers <b>of all levels</b> to build <b>robust</b>, <b>on-brand</b> products ranging from simple static sites through to rich, dynamic web applications, to do it <b>faster</b>, to do it <b>cheaper</b>, and leave them more <b>supportable</b> and more <b>maintainable</b>.</p>

This standard is equally for component developers and those who want to build websites using existing components.  These two roles will be distinguished in this standard as **component developer** and **product developer**.

The things being built by component developers are **components**, while the sites, products, tools or services being build by the product developers as new services to FT readers are **product applications**.

## Where to start

* If you're a non-technical stakeholder wondering what all the fuss is about and how Origami will affect you, read the [overview]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/overview/non-technical), which explains what problems we are solving and how Origami will help
* If you're a product developer, read the [developer guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/developer-guide) to understand how to use Origami components in your product.
* If you're a component developer, read the [component spec]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/component-spec) which sets out the rules that your components must conform to in order to be Origami components.
